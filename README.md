Dear user,

This file includes the project of two students from ESILV (Paris).This presentation is about a dataset for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition.

You will find several files there:
- An .IPYNB file containing a complete analysis of the dataset as well as several prediction models (machine learning).
- A folder containing several files allowing the creation of the Dr. Esilv site. This site makes it possible to predict the physical condition of a user thanks to a form to be filled. To predict this, we use the most efficient model of the .IPYNB file.
- A PowerPoint presentation explaining the stages of our research as well as the results obtained for each machine learning model.

Indeed, our research allowed us to discover how to classify a person according to his physical condition by using to several information such as his age, his weight, his habits, ect ...
During this research, we used several prediction models such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Bagging Classifier, Random Forest, ADA Boost Classifier, KNN Classifier & MLP Classifier. We were able to conclude that the most relevant data was the weight and height of the individual, which seemed quite logical.
The most accurate prediction model is the Random Forest, which gives an accuracy of 98.4%.

Thank you for your interest !

See you soon on Dr Esilv !!
